# HTML Assessment

For this week's project, we had to learn HTML in a self-taught approach. We used resources such as Codecademy to grasp the basic principles of HTML during class, and for homework, we were tasked with replicating a website. I decided to revisit the FreeCodeCamp HTML course to refresh my knowledge on the subject.

## The technologies I used included:

1. HTML
2. Git
3. Visual Studio Code
4. Sublime Text

## In terms of resources:

1. W3Schools
2. Codecademy
3. FreeCodeCamp

Through the FreeCodeCamp HTML course, I discovered new HTML features that I was not aware existed, such as the `legend` and `fieldset` elements. Overall, it was a great learning experience, and I would definitely do it again if given the chance.
