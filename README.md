    <h1>HTML Assessment</h1>
    <p>For this week's project, we had to learn HTML in a self-taught approach. We used resources such as Codecademy to grasp the basic principles of HTML during class, and for homework, we were tasked with replicating a website. I decided to revisit the FreeCodeCamp HTML course to refresh my knowledge on the subject.</p>
    <h2>The technologies I used included:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>HTML</li>
      <li>Git</li>
      <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
      <li>Sublime Text</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>In terms of resources</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>W3Schools</li>
      <li>Codecademy</li>
      <li>FreeCodeCamp</li>
    </ol>




    </ol>
    <p>Through the FreeCodeCamp HTML course, I discovered new HTML features that I was not aware existed, such as the <code>legend</code> and <code>fieldset</code> elements. Overall, it was a great learning experience, and I would definitely do it again if given the chance.</p>
